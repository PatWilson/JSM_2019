There has been unprecedented growth in the number of publications in the biomedical and clinical sciences.  However, there has been a substantial lack of progress in translating this work into the healthcare system. An often cited statistic purports that evidence-based practices (EBPs), i.e.  practices with scientific rationale, take on average 17 years to be incorporated into routine clinical practice. Basic research is vital, but there needs to be an aim towards translation with clear applications in mind to improve the health of the public. Failures in mitigating this research to practice gap can have negative consequences by eroding the public’s trust in research. An entire field of study known as Dissemination and Implementation science (D&I) has emerged to try and discover reasons as to why this gap exists and find ways to fix it. There are many hurdles that this science needs to overcome. Statisticians have developed the methods necessary to overcome these challenges and bridge the research practice gap.

### Creating more generalizable trials

Randomized controlled trials are considered the gold standard in clinical research.  They are normally designed with stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria to test the efficacy of a treatment in an ideal situation.  Although this is vital for elucidating biological mechanisms a major drawback exists for translation: patients don’t look like the typical patient in practice. Statisticians can develop methods that create more flexible designs that can be implemented in practice, which will produce evidence more in line with the clinician’s decision making.

### Addressing complex interventions 

Today’s healthcare environment consists of highly complex interventions containing intricate protocols which require the coordination of interdisciplinary teams of clinicians and other staff. What components are intrinsic to success? What components can be adapted to a new population? Statistical models that can illuminate mechanisms can go a long way to address these questions and evaluate phenomena unique to practice like adherence, adaptation, quality and context. Doctors will feel the impact of statistics when they can clearly map their issues and problems seen in the clinic to statistical models published in the literature.

### Meaningful statistics

Modern statistical packages produce a standard output of figures and tables of statistics that are the bread and butter of academic publications. This current state has evolved through a conglomeration of statistical thought, convention, and software design principally aimed toward the average statistician.  However, an often overlooked voice in these outputs is that of the clinical decision maker and patient.  Statisticians can develop flexible estimators that are interpretable and our targeted specifically to practicing clinicians. By building models that directly estimate the quantity of interest, practitioners can get a better sense of how research can impact their patient populations.
